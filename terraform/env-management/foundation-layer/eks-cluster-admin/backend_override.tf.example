# Backend Override for Local Execution
# =============================================================================
# Copy this file to backend_override.tf for local execution with 1Password CLI.
#
# This overrides the cloud backend to use local execution mode, which means:
# - Terraform runs locally on your machine (where `op` CLI is available)
# - State is still stored in Terraform Cloud
#
# Usage:
#   cp backend_override.tf.example backend_override.tf
#   export OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN="ops_..."
#   terraform init -reconfigure
#   terraform plan
# =============================================================================

terraform {
  cloud {
    organization = "Datafaced"

    workspaces {
      name = "management-foundation-eks-cluster-admin"
    }
  }
}

# Note: You also need to set the workspace execution mode to "Local" in TFC UI:
# 1. Go to: https://app.terraform.io/app/Datafaced/workspaces/management-foundation-eks-cluster-admin/settings/general
# 2. Under "Execution Mode", select "Local"
# 3. Save settings
