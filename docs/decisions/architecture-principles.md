## Infrastructure & Cloud Principles

### 1. Multi-Cloud Ready
Design decisions should not lock us into a single cloud provider. Consider portability and abstraction when choosing technologies and patterns.

### 2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- All infrastructure must be defined, versioned, and managed as code
- No manual changes in production environments
- Infrastructure changes follow the same workflow as application code
- Use declarative configuration over imperative scripts

### 3. Environment Isolation
- Maintain strict separation between Dev, Staging, and Production
- Use separate cloud accounts/projects per environment
- Blast radius containment: failures in one environment don't affect others
- Identical infrastructure definitions across environments (parameterized)

### 4. Immutable Infrastructure
- Replace rather than modify infrastructure components
- No configuration drift through manual changes
- Version and track all infrastructure changes
- Treat infrastructure as disposable and reproducible

## Security & Compliance Principles

### 5. Security by Default
- Implement principle of least privilege for all access controls
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- Default-deny security postures
- Secrets never in source control (use secret management tools)

### 6. Policy as Code
- Enforce security, compliance, and governance policies through automated checks
- Policies are versioned, tested, and reviewed like code
- Shift-left: validate policies before deployment (e.g., Sentinel, OPA)
- Preventive controls over detective controls

### 7. Compliance First
- Build in compliance requirements from the beginning
- Automated audit trails for all infrastructure changes
- Maintain evidence for compliance frameworks (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.)
- Regular automated compliance scanning

---

## Development & Operations Principles

### 8. GitOps Workflow
- Git as single source of truth for infrastructure state
- All changes through pull requests with peer review
- Automated validation and testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Audit trail through Git history

### 9. Modular & Reusable
- Create reusable Terraform modules for common patterns
- DRY principle: don't repeat infrastructure definitions
- Compose complex infrastructure from simple, tested modules
- Maintain module library with versioning and documentation

### 10. Test Everything
- Validate Terraform syntax and formatting (terraform fmt, validate)
- Static analysis and linting (tflint, checkov, tfsec)
- Policy validation before apply
- Automated integration tests for critical infrastructure
- Plan review before apply in production

### 11. Observability Built-In
- Infrastructure changes are logged and monitored
- State changes trigger notifications
- Drift detection runs automatically
- Costs tracked and alerted on anomalies

---

## Collaboration & Workflow Principles

### 12. Team Collaboration
- Enable multiple people to work simultaneously without conflicts
- Clear ownership and responsibility (CODEOWNERS)
- Self-service infrastructure through standardized modules
- Documentation lives with code

### 13. Progressive Deployment
- Changes validated in lower environments first (Dev → Staging → Production)
- Manual approval gates for production changes
- Rollback capability for failed changes
- Canary deployments where applicable

### 14. Operational Simplicity
- Prefer managed services over self-managed solutions
- Optimize for team productivity and maintainability
- Reduce cognitive load through consistency and standards
- Automate toil away

---

## Cost & Efficiency Principles

### 15. Cost Conscious
- Consider total cost of ownership (infrastructure + engineering time)
- Tag all resources for cost allocation and tracking
- Right-size resources based on actual usage
- Automated cost optimization opportunities flagged

### 16. Efficient State Management
- State files stored securely with encryption
- State locking prevents concurrent modifications
- State versioning for rollback capability
- Regular state backups

---

## Terraform-Specific Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Consistent directory structure across all projects
- Separate concerns: networking, compute, data, security
- Environment-specific variable files
- Shared modules in separate repositories

### Resource Naming
- Consistent naming conventions across all resources
- Include environment, purpose, and region in names
- Names should be human-readable and self-documenting

### Version Pinning
- Pin Terraform version in configuration
- Pin provider versions for reproducibility
- Pin module versions (no floating tags like "latest")
- Regular, controlled updates to newer versions

### State Management
- Remote state backend (never local for teams)
- State locking enabled
- Separate state files per environment
- State isolation per logical component/service

## Application Guidelines

- When multiple options exist, choose the one that best aligns with these principles
- If a decision conflicts with a principle, document the trade-off explicitly in the ADR
- Review these principles annually or when organizational priorities change
- Propose additions/changes through the ADR process
