Setting up Terraform for a new greenfield infrastructure project across separate AWS accounts (Dev, Staging, and Production) requires several key architectural decisions, primarily focused on isolation, modularity, security, and consistent deployment workflows.

Here are the key architectural decisions regarding your Terraform setup:

### 1. Environment Isolation Strategy

Given you are using **separate AWS accounts** for each environment (Dev, Staging, Production), you must ensure strong isolation, especially for state management.

| Decision | Details & Best Practices |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Use Separate Backends for Each Environment** | Using multiple, distinct Terraform backends (S3 buckets) is critical for isolating state between Dev, Staging, and Production. This provides **stronger isolation** than using Terraform workspaces. The default remote backend for AWS is **Amazon S3** for secure storage and DynamoDB for locking. |
| **Adopt Directory/File Layout for Isolation** | For isolating environments (staging vs. production), directories/folders are the preferable structure over Terraform *workspaces*. Workspaces should be avoided for environment separation because they typically use the same backend authentication and lack visibility, making accidental deployments easier. |
| **Implement a Standard File Structure** | Your infrastructure should be organized with **separate folders** for each environment (e.g., `stage`, `prod`) and **separate folders for each component** (e.g., `vpc`, `services`, `data-storage`) within that environment. This setup isolates state files, limiting the "blast radius" of errors. |

### 2. State Management and Security

Since the Terraform state file stores the mapping of configured resources and may contain sensitive data, securing it is paramount.

| Decision | Details & Best Practices |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Enable Remote State and Locking** | Use a **remote backend** (Amazon S3) to store the state files in a shared, central location. Use **Amazon DynamoDB** alongside S3 to implement state locking, which prevents race conditions and corruption when multiple team members attempt concurrent updates. |
| **Secure State Files** | Ensure remote state storage (S3) is configured with **server-side encryption (SSE)**. |
| **Restrict Production Access** | Lock down permissions for the **Production state backend** to **read-only access** for most users. Limit who can modify the production infrastructure state to the automated CI/CD pipeline or designated *break-glass* roles. |
| **Enable S3 Versioning** | Enable versioning on your S3 state bucket so that every revision of your state file is stored, allowing you to roll back if necessary. |

### 3. Modularity and Code Structure

Modularity is key for writing "production-grade" code, minimizing duplication, and enabling maintainability and testing.

| Decision | Details & Best Practices |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Adopt a Multi-Repository Approach** | Maintain at least two separate Git repositories: one for your reusable, versioned **modules** (the "blueprints") and one for the **live infrastructure** configurations (the "houses") that call those modules in Dev/Staging/Production folders. |
| **Design Small, Composable Modules** | Modules should be **small, self-contained, and composable**. They should logically group related resources and abstract complexity. Aim for modules that handle one thing (e.g., a rolling ASG cluster, a specific database component). |
| **Implement Module Versioning** | Use Git tags (e.g., `v0.0.1`) to version your reusable modules. This is crucial for **safely promoting changes**: you can deploy and test a new version (e.g., `v0.0.2`) in Staging before applying it to Production. |
| **Define a Module API** | Use **input variables** (module arguments) to configure modules for different environments (e.g., different instance sizes in Staging vs. Production). Use **output variables** to expose necessary resource attributes to other configurations (like exposing a database address to a web cluster module). |
| **Centralize Provider Configuration** | Do not define `provider` blocks within your reusable modules (this is an antipattern). Provider configuration (like AWS region or `assume_role` blocks) should be declared **once in the root/live module**. Modules should declare required providers and accept provider references from the calling module if they need multi-provider interactions. |

### 4. Security and Authentication

Security controls are vital, especially when provisioning across multiple sensitive AWS accounts.

| Decision | Details & Best Practices |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Use IAM Roles for Authentication** | **Avoid hardcoding static access keys** in configuration files. Instead, prefer using **IAM roles** (e.g., instance profiles for EC2, or roles assumed by CI/CD) which grant temporary, rotating credentials and follow the principle of **least privilege**. |
| **Multi-Account Authentication** | To deploy resources across different AWS accounts from a central management process, use provider blocks with the `alias` parameter and the `assume_role` configuration. |
| **Protect Sensitive Input Variables** | Use environment variables (prefixed with `TF_VAR_`) or dedicated secret stores (like AWS Secrets Manager) to pass sensitive data (such as database passwords) to Terraform without storing them in code or state files. |

### 5. Deployment Workflow and Automation

A systematic and automated workflow reduces human error and ensures consistency.

| Decision | Details & Best Practices |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Automate via CI/CD** | All Terraform infrastructure deployments should be run from a **CI server** (e.g., GitHub Actions, CircleCI) rather than a developer's local machine. This ensures a consistent environment and centralized permission management. |
| **Implement Plan Review Gates** | For deployments to Staging and Production, the workflow should include an approval step where `terraform plan` output is **manually reviewed and approved** before `terraform apply` is executed. This provides a final safety check, as infrastructure changes can be costly. |
| **Integrate Automated Testing** | Incorporate different testing types into your workflow: **static analysis** (using tools like `terraform validate`, TFLint, Checkov) to find errors preemptively and integration/end-to-end tests (using tools like Terratest) that deploy and validate infrastructure in an isolated test account. |
| **Enforce Coding Standards** | Enforce consistent Terraform formatting and style using tools like `terraform fmt` in your CI/CD pipeline or via pre-commit hooks. Use governance guardrails, such as Sentinel policies, to enforce organizational standards (e.g., requiring specific tags on resources). |
| **Pin All Dependency Versions** | Explicitly pin the versions for **Terraform core**, the **AWS Provider**, and all **reusable modules** to ensure compatibility and predictability. The provider version constraints should be defined in a `versions.tf` file using the `required_providers` block. |
