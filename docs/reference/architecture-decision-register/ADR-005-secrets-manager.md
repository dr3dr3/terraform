# ADR-005: Selection of Cloud-Based Secrets Manager Service

## Status
Proposed

## Context
We are establishing a personal learning lab environment to gain hands-on experience with cloud infrastructure and DevOps practices that mirror production enterprise environments. As part of this setup, we need to select a secrets management service for storing and managing sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, certificates, and other secrets.

### Requirements
- **Personal Learning Environment**: Single-user environment for educational purposes
- **Cost Optimization**: Minimize operational costs while maintaining production-like practices
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Must integrate seamlessly with Terraform
- **CI/CD Integration**: Must work with GitHub Actions pipelines
- **Cloud Provider**: Primary infrastructure is AWS-based
- **Managed Service**: No self-hosted solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault self-managed)
- **Best Practices**: Follow enterprise-grade security patterns despite being a learning environment

### Constraints
- Limited budget (personal expense)
- Single user/operator
- Learning-focused rather than production workloads
- Must support multi-environment patterns (dev, staging, prod simulation)

## Decision Drivers
1. **Cost**: Monthly operational costs and pricing model
2. **Terraform Integration**: Native provider support and maturity
3. **AWS Integration**: Seamless integration with AWS services
4. **GitHub Actions Support**: Ease of authentication and secret retrieval in CI/CD
5. **Learning Value**: Alignment with industry practices and career development

## Decision

**Selected Option: AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store (Standard Parameters with SecureString)**

## Rationale

AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store with Standard Parameters provides the optimal balance for a personal learning lab:

### Cost Justification
- **$0.00/month** for up to 10,000 standard parameters eliminates ongoing costs
- Even if scaling to advanced parameters, costs remain minimal ($0.05/parameter/month)
- API calls are negligible in learning environment usage patterns
- Allows budget to be allocated to other AWS services for learning

### Technical Alignment
- Provides production-grade patterns used in real enterprises
- Native AWS integration teaches valuable AWS-ecosystem skills

- GitHub Actions integration via AWS OIDC demonstrates modern DevOps practices
- IAM policies provide hands-on experience with least-privilege access
- CloudTrail integration teaches audit logging patterns

### Learning Value
- Widely adopted in production environments (high career relevance)
- Foundation for understanding AWS Secrets Manager (easy upgrade path)
- Teaches parameter hierarchies and organization patterns
- Opportunity to implement custom secret rotation scripts (learning experience)
- Demonstrates cost-optimization decisions made in real businesses

### Practical Considerations
- Zero friction with existing AWS infrastructure
- Simple to implement and maintain
- Can scale to advanced parameters if needed
- Provides upgrade path to AWS Secrets Manager when rotation is needed
- Complements GitHub Secrets for CI/CD-specific credentials

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. Enable AWS Systems Manager in target regions
2. Create parameter naming convention (e.g., `/env/service/secret-name`)
3. Configure KMS keys for encryption
4. Set up IAM roles and policies for parameter access
5. Document parameter organization structure

### Phase 2: Terraform Integration (Week 1-2)
```hcl
# Example Terraform pattern
resource "aws_ssm_parameter" "db_password" {
  name  = "/dev/database/master_password"
  type  = "SecureString"
  value = var.db_password
  
  tags = {
    Environment = "dev"
    ManagedBy   = "terraform"
  }
}

# Reading parameters
data "aws_ssm_parameter" "db_password" {
  name = "/dev/database/master_password"
}
```

### Phase 3: GitHub Actions Integration (Week 2)
1. Configure AWS OIDC authentication for GitHub Actions
2. Create IAM role for GitHub Actions with SSM read permissions
3. Implement secret retrieval in workflows
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Configure AWS credentials
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
  with:
    role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:role/GitHubActionsRole
    aws-region: us-east-1

- name: Retrieve secrets
  run: |
    SECRET=$(aws ssm get-parameter --name /dev/api/key --with-decryption --query Parameter.Value --output text)
```

### Phase 4: Application Integration (Week 3)
1. Implement secret retrieval in application code (AWS SDK)
2. Add caching strategy to minimize API calls
3. Implement graceful failure handling
4. Document secret access patterns

### Phase 5: Operations & Best Practices (Week 4+)
1. Set up parameter expiration notifications
2. Implement manual rotation procedures
3. Create rotation runbook
4. Set up CloudTrail monitoring for parameter access
5. Document upgrade criteria for AWS Secrets Manager

## Migration Path

If automatic rotation or additional features become necessary:

1. **When to Migrate to AWS Secrets Manager**:
   - Need automatic secret rotation
   - Database credentials requiring frequent rotation
   - Compliance requirements emerge
   - Budget allows ($4-8/month becomes acceptable)

2. **Migration Approach**:
   - Terraform makes migration straightforward
   - Change resource type from `aws_ssm_parameter` to `aws_secretsmanager_secret`
   - Update IAM policies
   - Minimal application code changes (AWS SDK compatible)

## Consequences

### Positive
- Zero monthly costs for foreseeable usage
- Production-grade security patterns
- High learning value aligned with career goals
- Simple to implement and maintain
- Excellent integration with AWS ecosystem
